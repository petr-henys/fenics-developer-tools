FEniCS Developer Tools
======================

This repository contains various tools,
including scripts for building, installation, and release of the
various FEniCS software components.


FEniCS Install (fenics-install.sh)
==================================

FEniCS Install is a simple script for easy installation of FEniCS
via HashDist. To install, simply run the script ``fenics-install.sh``.

This may be done via the following command(s)::

  wget -O - http://fenicsproject.org/fenics-install.sh | bash

Or if :code:`wget` is not available, use::

  curl -s http://fenicsproject.org/fenics-install.sh | bash

The script will show a menu where you can choose whether to install the
development version of FEniCS, the current stable version, or only the
dependencies. Setting the environment variable
``FENICS_INSTALL_BUILD_TYPE`` to either 0 (development), 1 (stable), or
2 (dependencies only) will not show this menu.


FEniCS Developer Install
========================

For developers, two additional scripts are provided:

* ``fenics-install-component.sh``
* ``fenics-install-all.sh``

The script ``fenics-install-component.sh`` configures, builds and installs
a given FEniCS component from the current directory.

The script ``fenics-install-all.sh`` first calls ``fenics-install.sh``
to configure, build and install all FEniCS dependencies (using
HashDist). It then proceeds to "manually" build all FEniCS components in
a structured way that helps developers quickly set up and maintain a
working FEniCS developer environment.
